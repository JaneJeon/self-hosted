Typesense is a lightweight alternative to Elasticsearch blah blah blah

I actually don't give a shit about any of that (I'll most likely be hosting Elasticsearch/Opensearch anyway down the line just for logging). I just want this so I can self-host Docusaurus search without relying on Algolia DocSearch, which has absolute shit support and has ghosted me for 2 years.

So yeah, fuck 'em.
