Use [beancount](https://beancount.github.io/docs/) + [Fava](https://beancount.github.io/docs/).

Motivation: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4Vz3wZB_8-ZcAwIFde8X5CjzKshE4-OXtVVHm4RQ8s/

Enter the actual transactions via the terminal on my mac, and sync the beancount file to server. The beancount file can then be mounted to https://github.com/yegle/fava-docker for an accessible web UI.

OFX import is possible, but enter every transaction (the stuff I spent via cards + investment buying/selling) manually as soon as I swipe, and set up scheduled reminders for bimonthly income + tax and monthly "other" expenses that I don't control (such as my sister's spending).

It should be easy to keep track of what to enter when, as my cards all have notifications turned on, either by text or by apple wallet.
